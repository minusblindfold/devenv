# devenv

> [!CAUTION]
> This is highly opinionated and intentionally simple. It's meant as an introduction to a development environment integrated with Claude Code — not a one-size-fits-all setup. Adapt it to your own workflow.

My personal dev environment configuration. Managed with a hand-rolled install script using symlinks.

→ **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)** — terminal, tools, and configuration.
→ **[Workflow Guide](docs/workflow-guide.md)** — the `/research → /plan → /design → /implement` loop and harness engineering rationale.

```

Work-specific config and secrets live in `~/.zshrc.local` (not tracked). `60-local.zsh` sources it automatically if present.

Claude skill config (backup limits, work dir, convention layers) lives in `claude/devenv.json`, symlinked to `~/.claude/devenv.json`. Work artifacts (`plans/`, `designs/`, `implementations/`, `research/`, and `.backup/` subdirs within each) are written to `.work/` in whatever project you're working in — add `.work/` to that project's `.gitignore`.

**Convention:** Any file ending in `.symlink` gets linked into `$HOME` with a dot prefix.

Scripts in `bin/` are symlinked to `~/.local/bin/` and made executable.

## Install

Clone the repo anywhere you like, then run the install script:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> ~/path/of/your/choice
cd ~/path/of/your/choice && ./install.sh
```

The repo path doesn't matter — the install script detects its own location at runtime and builds all symlinks relative to it. Dependencies (see `Brewfile`) are installed automatically. You'll be prompted once for your email for telemetry attribution.

The install script is **idempotent** — safe to run multiple times. It will:
- Symlink all `.symlink` files into `$HOME`
- Symlink `ghostty/config` into `~/.config/ghostty/`
- Symlink `starship/starship.toml` into `~/.config/`
- Symlink `claude/` config, hooks, and conventions into `~/.claude/`; each `claude/skills/<name>/` directory into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`
- Symlink `picker/paths` into `~/.config/devenv/paths` (skipped if user has customized paths)
- Symlink `docs/` into `~/.local/share/cheat/`
- Symlink all `bin/` scripts into `~/.local/bin/`
- Symlink `git-hooks/` into `~/.git-hooks/` and set `core.hooksPath`
- Symlink `zsh/devenv.zsh` into `~/.zsh/devenv.zsh` and inject a `source` line into `~/.zshrc` (never replaces it)
- Back up any existing files to `~/.dotfiles_backup/<timestamp>/` before replacing them

## Adding new config

1. Create a topic folder (e.g. `git/`, `vim/`)
2. Add your config file with a `.symlink` extension (e.g. `git/gitconfig.symlink`)
3. Run `./install.sh` to apply

## Tools
